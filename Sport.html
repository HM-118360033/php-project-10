            <p>Rugby has always been my favourite sport and the sport that has impacted me the most i started playing when I was 6 years old and continued playing until i was 16 years old. I started playing in cork constitution and quickly gained interest in the sport and the culture surrounding it  </p>

            <h2>GAA</h2>
                  <P>The Gaelic Athletic Association is an Irish international amateur sporting and cultural organisation, focused primarily on promoting indigenous Gaelic games and pastimes, which include the traditional Irish sports of hurling, camogie, Gaelic football, Gaelic handball and rounders. I have always had an interest in the GAA and played a lot as a child, In my opinion the sport is a huge source of pride for Irish people and allows us to celebrate our history and heritage as a nation </p>
