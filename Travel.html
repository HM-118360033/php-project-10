                <h2>Malaga, Spain</h2>  
            <p>Málaga is a port city on southern Spain’s Costa del Sol, known for its high-rise hotels and resorts 
                jutting up from yellow-sand beaches. Looming over that modern skyline are the city’s 2 massive hilltop citadels, the Alcazaba and ruined Gibralfaro,
                remnants of Moorish rule. The city's soaring Renaissance cathedral is nicknamed La Manquita ("one-armed lady") because one of its towers was curiously left unbuilt.         
                I visited Malaga in Spain last year and consider it one of the best cities to visit in Spain and Europe due to it sights,food,beaches and culture.  </p>

            <h2>Hawaii</h2>
            <p>Hawaii, a U.S. state, is an isolated volcanic archipelago in the Central Pacific. Its islands are renowned for their 
                rugged landscapes of cliffs, waterfalls, tropical foliage and beaches with gold, red, black and even green sands. Of the 6 main islands, 
                Oahu has Hawaii’s biggest city and capital, Honolulu, home to crescent Waikiki Beach and Pearl Harbour's WWII memorials. Hawaii is an 
                amazing island glorified by travellers and I have the intention to travel there in the future</p>

            <h2>Ha Long Bay</h2>
            <p> Hạ Long Bay, in northeast Vietnam, is known for its emerald waters and thousands of towering limestone islands topped by rainforests.
                Junk boat tours and sea kayak expeditions take visitors past islands named for their shapes, including Stone Dog and Teapot islets. 
                The region is popular for scuba diving, rock climbing and hiking, particularly in mountainous Cát Bà National Park.
                This region is a place I'd love to explore. </p>
